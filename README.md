# MyCrab Autonomous Cloudflare Tunnel Skill

This skill enables any AI agent (like OpenClaw or any MCP-enabled assistant) to autonomously set up, configure, and manage high-performance Cloudflare Tunnels using the **mycrab.space** service.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Zero-Config Handshake**: The agent automatically handles the entire API negotiation, certificate retrieval, and tunnel configuration.
- **Universal Port Forwarding**: Effortlessly tunnel any local port (npm's 3000, Python's 5000, etc.) to a public URL.
- **Multi-Tunnel Orchestration**: Serve multiple folders and complex application stacks simultaneously from a single machine.
- **Persistent & Branded Domains**: Support for affordable ($10/year) persistent subdomains for a permanent, easy-to-remember web presence.
- **Proactive Creative Deployment**: The agent is empowered to build a custom, visually stunning "AI Space" homepage while DNS propagates.

## 🌍 Platform Compatibility

This skill is designed to be cross-platform and runs seamlessly on:
- **macOS**
- **Linux** (Servers & Desktops)
- **Docker**
- **Android** (via Termux)

## 📦 Usage

Add the `SKILL.md` file to your agent's skills or instructions directory. The agent will handle the rest.
